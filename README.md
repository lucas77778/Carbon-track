# Carbon Track - Your Green Travel Companion 🌍

## Project Background

In an era of increasing global climate change, reducing carbon emissions has become one of humanity's greatest challenges. The transportation sector accounts for approximately 24% of global carbon emissions, with private vehicles contributing a significant portion. Carbon Track aims to help users through technological means to:

- Track real-time carbon emissions from personal travel
- Develop green travel habits
- Motivate users to choose low-carbon transportation through social rankings
- Provide detailed carbon emission data analysis and visualization
